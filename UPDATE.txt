## Week 9: Data with Javascript

### **Type of Data Displayed**
The home page dynamically displays travel destination data using a JavaScript array of objects.  
Each destination includes the following fields:

- `name`: the city and country name  
- `description`: a short travel introduction  
- `rating`: a numeric score
- `imagePath`: the path to the city’s image  
(15 items are generated by ChatGPT)


### **How JavaScript Creates the HTML**
The `data.js` file stores all travel data inside a constant array named `destinations`.  
Then, `script.js` reads this array and uses a `forEach()` loop to:
1. Create HTML elements (`div`, `img`, `h3`, `p`, and `span`) with `document.createElement()`  
2. Set their text and image attributes dynamically from the data  
3. Append each completed card into the container
